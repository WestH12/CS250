# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret and implement user needs through applying great attention to details to the client/user feedback. By discerning the critical details and facts, it is a seamless process to create user stories which will assist in properly developing them into the program. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs with an open mind towards the overall process while trying to identify the key building blocks of the program. After finding one or more key block, I wade into the development process and step my way through. However, sometimes I do need to take a couple steps back and then keep moving forward. In my future development work, I hope to potentially incorporate a product backlog and assign weights to the items within them. Implementing this will give me a more detailed view of the short term while also having a general idea about the future work required. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member for me means being open, honest, respectable, and friendly to all. While I might not always be delivering good news or feedback, it does not mean I have to do it in a rude or disrespectful manner. I wish for my team members to think of me as someone they can count on and who is always there to help them if needed.
